# The Idea

> **1:1 stablecoin swaps.**

That's it. Swap USDC for USDT at exactly 1:1. No slippage. No fees.

The tradeoff? Time. When reserves are available, swaps are instant. When they're not, you wait in a queue until someone deposits what you need.

Traditional DEXs give you a worse rate to guarantee instant execution. DollarStore gives you the perfect rate and asks you to wait if necessary.

## Why this matters

Stablecoins are supposed to be worth $1. Yet swapping between them on a DEX costs 0.01-0.3% in slippage and fees. On a $1M swap, that's $1,000-$3,000 lost to market mechanics.

DollarStore eliminates this by refusing to compromise on price. You either get 1:1 or you wait.

## Who this is for

- **Aggregators** integrating stablecoin routes (1inch, CowSwap, 0x)
- **Protocols** needing predictable stablecoin conversion
- **Anyone** who values price over speed
